The R package *lmForc* introduces functions for testing linear model forecasts and a new class for working with forecast data: Forecast. Test linear models out-of-sample by conditioning on realized values, vintage forecasts, or lagged values. Create and test performance weighted forecasts out-of-sample. Collect multiple forecasts and evaluate MSE or RMSE. These functions are all built around the Forecast class which matches the simplicity and interpretability of linear models.

## Vignette

For an overview of the *lmForc* package, please read the vignette: [lmForc Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmForc/vignettes/lmForc.html)

## Installation

To install the **stable** version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lmForc):
  
```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("lmForc")
```

To install the **development** version from [GitHub](https://github.com/lucius-verus-fan/lmForc):
  
```{r github-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lucius-verus-fan/lmForc")
```

## Example

Produce an out-of-sample forecast conditioned on realized values. This test 
calculates linear model coefficients in each period based on information that 
would have been available to the forecaster. These coefficients are then combined
with future realized values to compute a forecast. Evaluates the performance of a 
linear forecasting model had it been given perfect information.

```{r example1, message=FALSE}
library(lmForc)

forecast1 <- oos_realized_forc(
  lm_call = lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data),
  h_ahead = 2L,
  estimation_end = as.Date("2011-03-31"),
  time_vec = data$date
)

forecast1
```

Produce an out-of-sample forecast based on the historical mean. In each period 
the historical mean of the series is calculated based on information that would
have been available to the forecaster. Replicates the historical mean forecast 
that would have been produced in real time and serves as a benchmark for other models.


```{r example2, message=FALSE}
forecast2 <- historical_mean_forc(
  realized_vec = data$y,
  h_ahead = 2L,
  estimation_end = as.Date("2011-03-31"),
  time_vec = data$date
)

forecast2
```

Compare the performance of both models by calculating RMSE forecast error.

```{r example3, message=FALSE}
rmse(forecast1)
rmse(forecast2)
```
