The R package *lmForc* introduces functions for testing linear model forecasts and a new class for working with forecast data: Forecast. Test linear models out-of-sample by conditioning on realized values, vintage forecasts, or lagged values. Benchmark against AR models, historical average forecasts, or random walk forecasts. Create performance weighted or states weighted forecast combinations. These functions are built around the Forecast class which matches the simplicity and interpretability of linear models.

## Vignette

For an overview of the *lmForc* package, please read the vignette: [lmForc Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmForc/vignettes/lmForc.html)

## Installation

To install the **stable** version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lmForc):
  
```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("lmForc")
```

To install the **development** version from [GitHub](https://github.com/lucius-verus-fan/lmForc):
  
```{r github-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lucius-verus-fan/lmForc")
```

## Examples

Produce an out-of-sample forecast conditioned on realized values. Calculates linear model coefficients in each 
period based on information that would have been available to the forecaster. Coefficients are combined with
future realized values to compute a conditional forecast. Evaluates the performance of a linear model had it 
been conditioned on perfect information.

```{r example1, message=FALSE}
library(lmForc)

# Stylized dataset.
date <- as.Date(c("2010-03-31", "2010-06-30", "2010-09-30", "2010-12-31",
                  "2011-03-31", "2011-06-30", "2011-09-30", "2011-12-31", 
                  "2012-03-31", "2012-06-30"))
y    <- c(1.09, 1.71, 1.09, 2.46, 1.78, 1.35, 2.89, 2.11, 2.97, 0.99)
x1   <- c(4.22, 3.86, 4.27, 5.60, 5.11, 4.31, 4.92, 5.80, 6.30, 4.17)
x2   <- c(10.03, 10.49, 10.85, 10.47, 9.09, 10.91, 8.68, 9.91, 7.87, 6.63)
data <- data.frame(date, y, x1, x2)

# Out-of-sample forecast.
forecast1 <- oos_realized_forc(
  lm_call = lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data),
  h_ahead = 2L,
  estimation_end = as.Date("2011-03-31"),
  time_vec = data$date
)

forecast1
```

Produce an out-of-sample forecast based on the historical median. In each period 
the historical median of the series is calculated based on information that would
have been available to the forecaster. Replicates the historical median forecast 
that would have been produced in real time and serves as a benchmark for other models.


```{r example2, message=FALSE}
# Historical Median Forecast
forecast2 <- historical_average_forc(
  avg_function = "median",
  realized_vec = data$y,
  h_ahead = 2L,
  estimation_end = as.Date("2011-03-31"),
  time_vec = data$date
)

forecast2
```

Compare the performance of both models by calculating RMSE forecast error.

```{r example3, message=FALSE}
rmse(forecast1)
rmse(forecast2)
```

Create a performance weighted forecast combination of forecast1 and forecast2. In each period forecast 
accuracy is calculated over recent periods and each model is given a weight based on recent accuracy. The forecast for the next period is calculated as a weighted combination of both forecasts.

```{r example4, message=FALSE}
performance_weighted_forc(
  forecast1, forecast2,
  eval_window = 1L,
  errors = "mse",
  return_weights = FALSE
)
```
