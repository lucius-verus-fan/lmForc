Description: The R package lmForc introduces functions for testing linear model 
    forecasts and a new class for working with forecast data: Forecast. Test 
    linear models out-of-sample by conditioning on realized values, vintage 
    forecasts, or lagged values. Test MSE and RMSE weighted forecasts 
    out-of-sample. Create and save forecasts using the Forecast class.
